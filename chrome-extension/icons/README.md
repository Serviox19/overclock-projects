# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extensions management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store and installation)

## Quick Icon Generation

You can:
1. Create simple icons using online tools like [Canva](https://canva.com) or [Figma](https://figma.com)
2. Use [Icon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) for quick placeholder icons
3. Design custom icons in any image editor

## Temporary Solution

For testing, you can use any PNG images with the correct dimensions. The extension will still work with placeholder icons.
